    "Dark Mode must be the default theme on first visit/initial load; use a consistent palette: dark navy/black background, white/light-gray text, slightly lighter dark cards/buttons; ensure timer glow effect is tuned to look good on the dark palette across all routes (Dashboard, /timer, /community, /ncert).",
