# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display authenticated Google account name and photo across Community features (posts, comments, chat, Test History) and add a Study Room navbar entry linking to Google Meet.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all custom username editing controls from the UI
- Automatically sync authenticated profile data after Internet Identity login
- Update Community chat, comments, and post headers to display profile photo, bold display name, timestamp, and content with dark-mode compatible styling
- Add "Study Room" navbar entry with video camera icon that opens Google Meet link in new tab
- Show confirmation popup "You are joining Focus Babu Study Room." before redirecting with proceed/cancel options
- Include description text "Join live group study session and stay focused together." in confirmation dialog
- Ensure Study Room feature is fully responsive, mobile-friendly, and matches clean study-vibe design

**User-visible outcome:** Users see their Google account name and photo automatically in Community posts, comments, chat, and Test History without manual editing. A new Study Room navbar entry allows quick access to a shared Google Meet session with a confirmation dialog before joining.
