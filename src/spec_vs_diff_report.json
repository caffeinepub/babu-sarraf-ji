  "summary": "The diff implements the Study Room navigation feature with confirmation dialog (REQ-103 through REQ-106) and adds profile bootstrapping infrastructure (REQ-101), but does not implement the Community UI updates for profile photos/display names (REQ-102) or remove username editing controls (REQ-100). Profile display in posts, comments, and chat remains unchanged.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-100",
      "requirement": "Remove support for user-supplied/custom usernames in the UI and ensure the displayed name and avatar are sourced only from the authenticated profile data (or fallbacks), with no manual editing controls anywhere in the app.",
      "reason": "No evidence of removal of username editing controls. The ProfileSetupModal.tsx was added but content is not shown in the diff. No modifications to existing profile editing components are visible.",

      "reason": "No modifications to Community components are present in the diff. No changes to chat messages, comments, or post headers to add profile photos or update display name formatting.",
