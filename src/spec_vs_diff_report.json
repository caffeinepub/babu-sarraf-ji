  "summary": "Diff adds a reusable SocialLinks component with Instagram/X icons and updates the landing page header and footer to render them with correct external-link attributes and a soft glow hover style. Streamer-mode hiding for social icons on /timer appears to be implemented via data attributes and CSS rules. Follow text under the timer is indicated as added/conditional in the provided file summaries, but the PomodoroTimer diff content is truncated so direct verification is limited.",
